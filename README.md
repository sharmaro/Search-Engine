Hello

1) In order to compile and run crawler:
      type g++ -g -Wall crawler.cpp -o crawler
      run with ./crawler
      -If you would like to change the input and output files to test crawler,
       go to crawler.cpp and change lines 23 and 26
      
2) I didn't implement the config file so you have to run with ./search <name of input file>
 (without the angled brackets)
 
3) I used episilon as .15, that can be changed in front_end.cpp on lines 364, 472, 579, and 685.

4) Compile by typing make and running with ./search <name of input file>
